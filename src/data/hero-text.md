Welcome to the Daily Nexus, UC Santa Barbara’s award-winning student newspaper. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve moved our operations online. 

This spring, the Nexus is looking to recruit staff members and assistant editors of all years and levels of experience!

On this website, you’ll find information about each of our sections and the link to sign up for Spring Orientation, which will take place April 6 and 7 at 6 p.m. PST.

Even though we can’t meet in person, we are still fully operational, and we’re excited to meet you all.
