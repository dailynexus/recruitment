Welcome to the Daily Nexus, UC Santa Barbara’s award-winning student newspaper. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve moved our operations online. 

This fall, the Nexus is looking to recruit staff members and assistant editors of all years and levels of experience!

On this website, you’ll find information about each of our 13 sections and the link to sign up for Winter Orientation, which will take place January 12 and 13 at 6 p.m. PST.

Even though we can’t meet in person, we are still fully operational, and we’re excited to start the school year.
