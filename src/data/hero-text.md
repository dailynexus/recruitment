Welcome to the Daily Nexus, UC Santa Barbara’s award-winning student newspaper. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve moved our operations online. 

This fall, the Nexus is looking to recruit staff members and assistant editors of all years and levels of experience!

On this website, you’ll find information about each of our 13 sections and our Fall Quarter 2020 orientation sessions, which will take place on Oct. 6 and 7 at 6 p.m. over Zoom. At orientation, you’ll have the chance to chat with editors and check out what time they’re meeting over Zoom during the year. 

Even though we can’t meet in person, we are still fully operational, and we’re excited to start the school year.
