Welcome to the Daily Nexus, UC Santa Barbara’s award-winning student newspaper. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve moved our operations online. 

This fall, the Nexus is looking to recruit staff members and assistant editors of all years and levels of experience!

On this website, you’ll find information about each of our 13 sections and their Winter 2021 meeting times, which can be found at the linked calendar.

Even though we can’t meet in person, we are still fully operational, and we’re excited to start the school year.
