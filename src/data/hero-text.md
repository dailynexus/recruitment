Welcome to the Daily Nexus, UC Santa Barbara’s award-winning student newspaper.
The Nexus is UC Santa Barbara’s only independent, student-run newspaper. We’ve been reporting on UCSB and Isla Vista since the 1930s.

The Nexus includes 20 sections, with hundreds of writers, photographers, videographers, designers and more! 
No experience necessary to join. 

This fall, the Nexus is looking to recruit staff members and assistant editors of all years and levels of experience!

On this website, you’ll find information about each of our sections.
Fall Orientation will be held in-person on October 5 and 6 at 7 p.m. PST at our office, located underneath Storke Tower. See you there!
