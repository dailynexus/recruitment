Dear Reader,
Welcome to the Daily Nexus, UC Santa Barbara’s award-winning student newspaper.
The Nexus is UC Santa Barbara’s only independent, student-run newspaper. We’ve been reporting on UCSB and Isla Vista since the 1930s.

We are so happy to see your interest in joining our team. Whether you are a first-year trying to find your place on campus, or a fourth-year telling yourself you’d finally get around to joining that extracurricular you said you would – we are a space for you.

We are always looking for eager and passionate writers, videographers, photographers, and artists. Whatever fits your fancy.
From the hard breaking news headlines to the not so serious headlines like “I.V. landlord charges extra for mold: claims exotic houseplant.” I am sure we have something for you.
