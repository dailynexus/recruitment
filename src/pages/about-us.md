Since the 1930s, the Daily Nexus has been UCSB and Santa Barbara County’s go-to source for timely, relevant and essential editorial and feature coverage. The only independent, student-run newspaper at UCSB, the Nexus consists of 30+ editorial staff members and around 150 staff writers, artists, photographers, videographers and graphic designers. With 13 sections to choose from, there’s a place at the Nexus for everyone. We publish daily across print, online and social media platforms to ensure that our coverage remains accessible and engaging. Our funding comes from student fees and advertising revenue and operates independently of university oversight.
