**The opinion section is looking for writers for the 2020-21 school year.**

Love hot takes and debates? Then the opinion section is the perfect place for you!
Opinion writers cover any and every opinion on topics related to the UCSB student experience. 

We have six columns that our staff writers write under: Argument in the Office, Ask AJ
(our advice column), Self Study, Sign of the Times, Virtual Reality, and Mind, Body & Soul.
Opinion writers get to explore the things that they are most passionate about and collaborate 
with a group of passionate and outgoing individuals. Not to mention, our weekly meetings are
known to include kick-ass icebreakers and hilarious horoscope-writing sessions.
