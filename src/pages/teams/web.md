**The Web section is not currently hiring.**

The web team handles all the messy work behind the scenes, making sure the site runs smoothly and cleaning up when things break, as well as adding new features to the website to enhance the digital reader's experience. We also work on interactive projects throughout the year, such as this recruitment site.

Experience with WordPress, including HTML, CSS and PHP, is essential. Knowledge of JavaScript and React is also important, especially for work on the interactives.
