Being a staff artist for the Daily Nexus means you get to illustrate for the various sections of the paper such as, news, opinion, sports, comics and more! Additionally, there are unlimited opportunities to create comics off your own ideas. We are looking for artists who are able to creatively highlight and translate an article into an art piece. For quality purposes, artists are encouraged to work digitally, but scanned artwork is welcome! If you are interested in being an illustrator and/or comic artist, please email art@dailynexus.com with a few sample pieces.
