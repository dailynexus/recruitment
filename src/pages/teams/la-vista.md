**La Vista section is hiring for the 2023-24 school year.**

Hello and Hola! We are La Vista, the Nexusâ€™ first Spanish language media. At La Vista, our team focuses on translating important Nexus articles that affect the Spanish community to make our media more accessible as well as encourage the student body to branch into our community. In 2015, UCSB was recognized as a Hispanic-serving institution and we want to be able to effectively serve the Spanish-speaking community at the university. Our section, though focused on translating articles, is making initiatives toward focusing on original content. 

We are looking to hire an assistant editor as well as writers for the La Vista Section. These are paid positions. Fluency in speaking Spanish and English along with writing proficiency is essential in upholding professionalism in our writing. We strongly encourage anyone with an interest in Spanish translation and writing to apply.

We are also looking to build a team of translators who will work with the section editor to translate articles in a timely manner and be an active member in the section. Translators will be paid by the article.

Please contact Amanda Marroquin and Sneha Cheenath at [diversityandinclusion@dailynexus.com](mailto:diversityandinclusion@dailynexus.com), or Mari Villalpando-Ortega at [lavista@dailynexus.com](mailto:lavista@dailynexus.com) for more information.
