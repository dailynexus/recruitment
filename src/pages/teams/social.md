The social media team consists of Joshen Mantai, the Director of Social Media Strategy, and two social media managers, Jordan Chang and Ida Kazerani. Together, we work to implement social initiatives for the Daily Nexus. Jordan works on scheduling regular content to our Facebook and Twitter social media channels, and Ida works on Instagram, including numerous Instagram series we have been implementing.
 
Overall, we work to increase visibility of each section's content and highlight the accomplishments of the staff currently working for us. We are also always strategizing new engaging ways to deliver content, including our recent project, [the Nexus weekly newsletter.](https://dailynexus.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c7afb6c46dbbdcd7bb0bd8919&id=7220084bdc)
 
One of our main goals is to recruit new potential writers and staff members, like you! Let us know if you have any questions by emailing us at [socialmedia@dailynexus.com](mailto:socialmedia@dailynexus.com).
