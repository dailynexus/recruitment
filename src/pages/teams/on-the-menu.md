**The On the Menu section is looking for reporters for the 2023-24 school year.**

On the Menu is the section of the Daily Nexus dedicated to all things food! We are a collection of foodies who write recipes, restaurant reviews, food-related event coverage, interviews with restaurant owners and more!

This section has something for everyone because let’s face it — who doesn’t like food? If you’re an amateur home chef, you’d be great at creating new recipes and sharing kitchen skills for our section. But if cooking isn’t for you, you can also critique the latest food trends or explore other topics such as the connection between science and food.

One of the most exciting parts of writing for this section is reviewing local restaurants right when they open and collaborating with our photo and video teams to make corresponding videos for our articles! We also occasionally get invited to new restaurants in the Santa Barbara and Goleta area, so we’re able to get first-hand experience at these new local food spots and share the inside scoop with our readers.

We are currently looking for writers of all experience levels for the 2023-24 school year. Email us at [onthemenu@dailynexus.com](mailto:onthemenu@dailynexus.com) and we’ll add you to our Slack channel so you can start writing! Don’t forget to follow us on Instagram [@ucsbonthemenu](https://www.instagram.com/ucsbonthemenu) for updates on our latest articles and food-related events on campus.
