**The On The Menu section is looking for writers for the 2020-21 school year.**

On the Menu is the section of the Daily Nexus dedicated to all things food-related. We are a collection of foodies who write recipes, restaurant reviews, health tips and more! 

This section has something for everyone because let’s face it — who doesn’t like food? If you’re an amateur home chef, you’d be great at creating new recipes and sharing kitchen skills for our section. But if cooking isn’t for you, you can also critique the latest food trends, test out a new diet or share nutrition tips. 

One of the most exciting parts of writing for this section is that we have the opportunity to receive press passes to local food events like Ramen Fest and the Gelato Festival. We also occasionally get invited to new restaurants in the Santa Barbara and Goleta area, so we’re able to get a first-hand experience for these new local food spots and share the inside scoop with our readers.
