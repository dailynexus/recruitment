**Our data section is looking for reporters for the 2020-21 school year.**

At The Labyrinth, the Nexus’ data journalism section, we combine journalism, code and design to produce data-driven reporting coupled with fun, interactive visuals. Whether this be tracking local COVID-19 cases, reporting on arrest statistics or visualizing the I.V. Community Services District’s new budget, we work to explain and visualize complex data in ways that UC Santa Barbara students and community members can easily understand.

In addition to producing our own content, we frequently collaborate with other sections, including news and opinion, to produce interactive graphics and infographics to help readers better comprehend the Nexus’ stories.
