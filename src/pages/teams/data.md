**Our data section is looking for reporters for the 2020-21 school year.**

The Daily Nexus, UCSB’s award-winning independent, student-run newspaper since 1930, is hiring writers for The Labyrinth, the Nexus's data journalism section. We combine journalism, code, and design to produce data-driven reporting coupled with fun, interactive visuals, including tracking local COVID-19 cases, reporting on arrest statistics and visualizing the I.V. Community Services District’s new budget. As part of the Daily Nexus, The Labyrinth often collaborates with other sections such as News and Opinion to produce interactive graphics and infographics.
