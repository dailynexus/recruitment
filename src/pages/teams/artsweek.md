**The Artsweek section is looking for reporters for the 2023-24 school year.**

The Daily Nexus’s Artsweek section covers the latest in music, movies, the entertainment industry and pop culture. We review recent film and album releases, report in-person on local events, write feature articles on student artists, and more.

Story grabs are given out during section meetings, which occur once a week, where writers can sign up to cover pieces on a first-come, first-served basis. Writers can pitch potential article ideas during the section meetings as well.

Artsweek is looking for writers for the 2023-24 school year. For more detailed information and answers to any questions you may have, feel free to contact us via email at [artsweek@dailynexus.com](mailto:artsweek@dailynexus.com)

And be sure to follow us on Instagram [@dailynexusartsweek](https://www.instagram.com/dailynexusartsweek/). Rock on!
