The *Daily Nexus*’s Artsweek section covers the latest in music, movies, the entertainment industry and pop culture. Our writers review recent film and album releases, report in-person on local events such as concerts and screenings, write feature articles on student artists, musicians, etc. and more.

Story grabs are given out during section meetings, which occur once a week, where writers can sign up to cover pieces on a first-come, first-served basis. Writers can pitch potential article ideas during the section meetings as well.

Be sure to attend the orientation for Artsweek for more detailed information and answers to any questions you may have! We hope to see you all there:)
