**Our video section is looking for videographers for the 2020-21 school year.**
 
We produce videos for all the sections on the Nexus and are always looking for more videographers to join the team! We highlight the stories of interesting students on campus, and showcase local Isla Vista bands in our Batcave Sessions to name a few of our projects. We also work to provide the flexibility and creative freedom for our videographers to create whatever content they are interested in. Email [video@dailynexus.com](mailto:video@dailynexus.com) for more information to join!
