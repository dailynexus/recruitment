Our division collaborates with each section to create content for the Nexus and is always looking for more videographers to join the team! We love to capture the various aspects of campus life and all the fun stuff that happens in Isla Vista. Most importantly, we work to provide the flexibility and creative freedom for our videographers to create content that every resident student at UCSB can enjoy. Please email [video@dailynexus.com](mailto:video@dailynexus.com) for more information on how to join our team!
