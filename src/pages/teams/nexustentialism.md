**Nexustentialism is looking for writers for the 2020-21 school year.**

Nexustentialism is the best (and only) satirical section of the Daily Nexus. Since its launch in 2014, Nexustentialism has been the voice behind some of UCSB's most renowned and controversial news pieces such as "Campus Crisis: Storke Tower Goes Flaccid,” "Sorority Sally: I Would Die For My Train Conductor Hat" and "Everybody on the Fourth Floor of Davidson Should Just Fuck Each Other Already.” They have been voted "most stinky" and also "sexiest feet" for over 50 consecutive years\*, which are coveted awards in the Nexus office. 

UCSB's version of The Onion, Clickhole, and Reductress, Nexustentialism takes pride in highlighting the weird, bizarre and inappropriate aspects of life and learning at UCSB and the greater Isla Vista community. No article is too crazy (just read [this prime example:(https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-01/chameleons-they-could-be-anywhere/)), and any student is qualified to join, regardless of major or previous writing experience. Section editors Emma and Max only ask that interested writers be weird in a non-creepy way and have at least four funny thoughts per week. 

Section meetings will begin at the start of fall quarter and are held weekly (exact time/day TBD). Until then, feel free to email [nexustentialism@dailynexus.com](mailto:nexustentialism@dailynexus.com) with an article idea, section inquiries or even a dank meme you saw and want us to see.
