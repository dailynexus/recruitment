The copy team reads and edits all articles at the Daily Nexus for accuracy, clarity and adherence to Associated Press style. We help make sure that all articles at the Nexus are consistent and correct to uphold the Nexus' reputation as a reliable and quality news source for the UCSB and Isla Vista communities.

By working on the copy team, we play an important role in the functioning of the paper â€” every single section works closely with copy to ensure that their articles are ready to be published. Copy gets to work with every section and gains a high-level look at the going ons of the Nexus and UCSB through reading every article!
