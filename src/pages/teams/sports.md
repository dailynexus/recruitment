**The sports section is looking for writers for the 2021-22 school year.**

The Daily Nexus sports section specializes in everything UCSB sports. As one of the only media outlets that covers Gaucho athletics, we strive for thorough, in-depth coverage of all Gaucho athletics. Because of UCSB's status as a mid-major school, our writers are able to receive media privileges such as sitting in the press box, attending press conferences and gaining access to athletes and coaches for interviews. Through previews, recaps and features, we seek to keep the UCSB community informed and engaged with UCSB athletics.

However, we cover far more than just local athletics. Writers are encouraged to write about anything sports-related that they are passionate about â€” even if it's not directly linked to UCSB. In the past, our section has specialized in articles that analyze the intersection between sports and society. These columns can cover essentially any topic and allow writers the creative freedom to pursue any sports-oriented interest they have.

Whether you're interested in UCSB athletics, professional sports or anything in between, feel free to reach out if you're interested or have any questions.
