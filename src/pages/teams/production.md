**Our production team is looking for graphic designers for the 2020-21 school year.**
 
Interested in graphic design? Come join the Daily Nexus production team! The production section is responsible for designing graphics and helping to layout the physical print newspaper. We have positions open on our graphics team, which focuses on creating graphics for all other sections of the paper. We often make traditional text-based graphics but love experimenting with new design styles and graphic art. We’re looking for students who are interested in learning more about graphic design and exploring their design skills in a fun environment. Experience with Adobe or Procreate is appreciated but not necessary! We are happy to work with all skill levels. For more information on joining the team, email [production@dailynexus.com](mailto:production@dailynexus.com) with any samples of work you’ve done in the past.
