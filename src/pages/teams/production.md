**Our production team is looking for graphic designers for the 2021-22 school year.**

Interested in graphic design? Come join the Daily Nexus production team! The production section is responsible for designing graphics and helping to layout the weekly print newspaper. We have positions open on our graphics team, which focuses on creating graphics for all other sections of the paper. We often make traditional text-based graphics but love experimenting with new design styles and graphic art! We are looking for experienced designers who are familiar with Adobe programs, Procreate, or other graphic design softwares. For more information on joining the team, email [production@dailynexus.com](mailto:production@dailynexus.com) with any samples of work youâ€™ve done in the past.
