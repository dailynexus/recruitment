**Our photo section is looking for photographers for the 2020-21 school year.**

Welcome to the photography section of the Daily Nexus.
 
We see a diverse range of events through our lens. Some are simply part of the daily life, like a campus building where something newsworthy happens; some are cheerful and spectacular, like [a DJ concert at Thunderdome](https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/in-photos-the-warmup-with-jpegmafia-troyboi/); some connect our campus to the issues pertaining to our time: [a community under the ongoing pandemic](https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-28/in-photos-santa-catalina-living-on-campus-during-a-pandemic/), the walk-outs and sit-ins for justice, including in regard to [race](https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-30/close-to-1000-march-to-sands-beach-for-justice-for-george-floyd-on-saturday/), immigration and [fair pay.](https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/in-photos-official-cola-strike-by-ucsb-students-staff/) As a photographer, you will have the opportunity to witness these moments for our community and tell the story by adding a visual dimension to Nexusâ€™ coverages.
 
We welcome students of all levels of experience to join. We are honored to have you if you are already a veteran in photography and no worries if you have never gotten into photography or campus press-related activities. We will hold seminars that guide our photographers (remotely) from the basics of using cameras to actual practice in photojournalism.
