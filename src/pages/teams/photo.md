Welcome to the photography section of the Daily Nexus!
 
Our photo section is looking for photographers for the 2021-2022 school year.
 
We not only see events first-hand through our lens, but we also see the diversity in our photographers who are behind these lenses. We believe that the photos we capture can translate into infinite meanings-- it's our way of storytelling. 
 
Our content consists of both the good and the bad within daily life, the campus and community, athletic games, current events from a global or local standpoint, and so much more. As a photographer, you will have the opportunity to be present in these moments and cater as the visual for Nexus coverage. 
 
We welcome all students from all levels of experience to join. Contact us at [photo@dailynexus.com](mailto:photo@dailynexus.com).
