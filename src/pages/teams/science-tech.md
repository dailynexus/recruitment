**The Science & Tech section is looking for writers for the 2023-24 school year. We will also be hiring assistant editor(s) at the start of winter quarter.**

UC Santa Barbara is known worldwide for its scientific research programs. From astrophysics to the environmental sciences, UCSB has made countless breakthroughs over the past decades, and continues every day to push the boundaries of what is possible. Our university, which Leiden University has named #2 world-wide for research impact in the sciences, is home to several Nobel laureates and is the birthplace of cutting-edge technology like the Practical Scanning Microscope and efficient blue LED lights. UCSB was also one of the very first nodes of the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), a predecessor to what we now call  “the internet.”

The Science and Tech section strives to cover all aspects of the sciences that are important and relevant to our readers; whether it is a column explaining the science behind [why our socks go missing in the wash](https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-02/simply-stated-where-did-my-other-sock-go/) or an article covering [a faculty member’s innovative vision technology](https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-07/ucsb-professor-receives-nih-directors-new-innovator-award/), the content being produced by our section is informative, accessible, and original. At a time when misinformation runs rampant in the news, and scientists often are unable to effectively share their own results with the public, science communication is more important than ever, and a valuable skill which will serve well those hoping to work in the sciences. 

Students interested in writing for us do not require any previous experience, and will be trained in the fundamentals of science writing, journalism writing, interview techniques and more. We expect that writers maintain professionalism and a commitment to their work. At the same time, we are a vibrant and enthusiastic staff dedicated to supporting each other, and work hard to create an environment that is both fun and enriching.
