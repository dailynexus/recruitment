As the Sports Editor of the Daily Nexus, your role will be to oversee the operations of the sports section.
Ultimately, the sports section’s main responsibility is to cover any and all UCSB sports through previews, recaps,
and features. Writers also have the option to write columns about professional sports, and the section prides itself
on covering the intersection between culture and sports.

Thus, your main responsibilities include:
* Holding weekly meetings with sports writers
* Sending out assignments to writers at the beginning of the week
* Creating the print pages of the sports section each week
* Attending editorial staff meetings
* Editing writers’ articles
* Posting articles on the Daily Nexus website
* Running the Daily Nexus Sports social media accounts - namely Twitter

The position will require approximately 10-15 hours per week. The Nexus runs year-round, including in the summer.
All work will be conducted remotely until further notice. Writers must be UCSB students. This is a paid position.
